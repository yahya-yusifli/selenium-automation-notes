**What is Selenium?**

- Selenium is an open-source tool for automating web browsers.
- It allows you to write test scripts in various programming languages such as Java, Python, C#, JavaScript, etc.
- Primarily used for functional and regression testing of web applications.

---

**Key Features of Selenium**

- Supports multiple browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari)
- Supports multiple OS (Windows, macOS, Linux)
- Integrates with tools like TestNG, JUnit, Maven, Jenkins, Docker
- Executes tests on local and remote machines (Grid)
- Large community and active support

**Why Use Selenium WebDriver?**

- More flexible and robust than IDE
- Allows direct interaction with browsers using driver executables
- Supports dynamic web elements
- Fully supports programming logic (conditions, loops, etc.)

---

**Languages and Frameworks**

- You can write Selenium tests in:
  - Java (commonly used with TestNG or JUnit)
  - Python (with PyTest or Unittest)
  - C# (with NUnit or MSTest)
  - JavaScript (with Mocha or Jest)

---

**Summary**

- Selenium is a browser automation tool for web apps
- WebDriver is the most widely used component
- It works with different languages, browsers, and platforms
