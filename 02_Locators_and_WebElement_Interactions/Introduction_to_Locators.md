# Introduction to Locators

Locators are the key to interacting with web elements in Selenium automation.  
They help Selenium find buttons, text fields, links, and other components on a web page.  
Choosing the right locator improves the stability, reliability, and speed of test scripts.

Types of Locators:
- ID
- Name
- Class Name
- Tag Name
- Link Text / Partial Link Text
- CSS Selector
- XPath
